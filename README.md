PROJECT OVERVIEW
Effective time management is essential for students and working individuals to organize their daily activities and responsibilities efficiently. With multiple tasks, meetings, and deadlines to manage, having a clear and structured way to track events is important to avoid conflicts and missed commitments. Calendar and scheduling applications provide a practical solution by allowing users to view, plan, and manage their time in an organized manner.

The main goal of this project is to develop a simple Calendar and Scheduler Application for personal use using the Java programming language. The application allows users to create, update, delete, and view events in different formats such as list views and calendar views. It also supports recurring events, enabling users to schedule repeating activities within a defined period.

To reinforce fundamental programming concepts, the application stores all event data using local CSV files instead of a database. This project emphasizes logical program flow, object-oriented programming principles, and file input/output handling. Overall, the application aims to provide a lightweight yet functional scheduling tool while strengthening the team’s understanding of core Java programming concepts.
