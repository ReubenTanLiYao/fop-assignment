PROJECT OVERVIEW

Effective time management is essential for students and working individuals to organize their daily activities and responsibilities efficiently. With multiple tasks, meetings, and deadlines to manage, having a clear and structured way to track events is important to avoid conflicts and missed commitments. Calendar and scheduling applications provide a practical solution by allowing users to view, plan, and manage their time in an organized manner.

The main goal of this project is to develop a simple Calendar and Scheduler Application for personal use using the Java programming language. The application allows users to create, update, delete, and view events in different formats such as list views and calendar views. It also supports recurring events, enabling users to schedule repeating activities within a defined period.

To reinforce fundamental programming concepts, the application stores all event data using local CSV files instead of a database. This project emphasizes logical program flow, object-oriented programming principles, and file input/output handling. Overall, the application aims to provide a lightweight yet functional scheduling tool while strengthening the team’s understanding of core Java programming concepts.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

• Basic Features:
Event Creation
Event Update & Delete
Recurring Events
Backup and Restore
View Calendar
Event Basic Search
Programming Skills, File System and Version Control System Usage

• Extra Features:
Event Advanced Search & Filter
The Event Advanced Search feature allows users to search for events using more detailed criteria beyond basic date-based searching. Users can filter events by event title keywords, date ranges, and event duration. This makes it easier to locate specific events, especially when the number of scheduled events increases.

This feature merits extra marks because it demonstrates the ability to process and filter stored data dynamically using multiple conditions. It also shows a deeper understanding of file reading, string processing, and logical comparisons, as well as improving overall usability of the application.

Event Statistics
The Event Statistics feature provides useful insights based on the user’s scheduled events. Examples of statistics implemented include the total scheduled time, average event duration, and analysis of event durations. These statistics help users understand how their time is being allocated and identify patterns in their schedule.

This feature deserves extra marks because it goes beyond basic CRUD operations and involves data aggregation, time calculations, and analytical thinking. It demonstrates the ability to extract meaningful information from raw event data and apply programming logic to produce useful summaries.

Additional Event Fields
The Additional Event Fields feature extends the basic event information by allowing extra details such as location, category, or notes to be stored separately in another CSV file. These additional fields are linked to events using the event ID and can be searched and included during backup and restore operations.

This feature merits extra marks as it shows extensibility in system design. By separating additional fields into a different file, the system remains modular and scalable. It also demonstrates careful data organization, file handling, and integration between multiple data sources.

Conflict Detection
The Conflict Detection feature checks whether a newly created event overlaps in time with existing events. If a scheduling conflict is detected, the system alerts the user and prevents the creation of overlapping events. This ensures that users do not accidentally schedule two events at the same time.

This feature deserves extra marks because it requires comparing time ranges and handling logical edge cases. It improves the reliability of the scheduler and reflects real-world calendar behavior. Implementing conflict detection shows an understanding of time-based logic and practical application design.
